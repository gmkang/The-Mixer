# The-Mixer

##Technologies Used:
- Javascript and jQuery were the languages used to perform DOM manipulations for creating and editing all the events. 
- Also used to initialize the MVC structure through Node.js/Express and all of the other useful npm packages. 
- SQL was employed to save, create and transfer essential data to the database. The database created was for the user and their security and another to store their saved data. Both tables were joined the by the user's primary key id. 
- HTML acted as an outline for the MVC model to render the appropriate data generated from the SQL database and axios/ajax calls to the API.
- CSS was utilized to creatively style the app. Skeleton was all used to offer simplistic design for the user's experience. 

##Approach:
- Before the coding process, whiteboarding, pseudo code and wireframing were used to gather and consolidate ideas. Regularly used postman for API calls to see what kind of object would be returned. Thereafter, I was able to build my database to properly store all the information I knew I needed. Once the databases were connected I started to build out my MVC structure filling in the elements and functionality I needed to appropriately generate my app. 
- The user database for authentication was first written out then I went on to build and edit my recipe MVC. 
- After creating the functionality I worked on updating my HTML and CSS.

##Wireframes:
- Original wireframes:
https://wireframe.cc/bVMsPl
https://wireframe.cc/x3bc9U
https://wireframe.cc/uN8LXo
https://wireframe.cc/cqc7xl
- Due to conflicts with the original API address the application created had to be adjusted. However, the new application was still inspired by my old wireframes.
